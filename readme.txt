WPRealty is being re-released under a different WordPress plugin name. This version is no longer supported.

== Description ==
`IMPORTANT! This version is NO LONGER SUPPORTED PLEASE DO NOT USE`
This 1.0.8 version of WP Realty was developed to place listings into your WordPress blog by bridging an open source application called OpenRealty into WordPress. This version should be considered an application bridge and although it works for the most part there are known bugs that can cause issues.
This version should NOT BE USED ANY LONGER.

== Installation ==
1. Extract the `wp-realty.1.0.6.zip` to your local system prior to upload.
1. Add the WP-REALTY-OR theme to your OpenRealty/admin/template directory and activate it.
1. Upload `wp-realty` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugin Panel' in WordPress
1. While in the WordPress admin panel, simply navigate to the "settings" area by clicking on the tab for "settings".
1. Set the full root path to your OpenRealty or EZPro Realty installation remembering to include the trailing slash.
1. Customize blog with template tags as you so desire. By default the main pages area added automatically.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1. Will this work if WordPress and OpenRealty are in the same database or separate databases?
*Yes for both!*

1. Will this work with WordPress MU?
*This version currently does not support MU*

1. Will this work for sites other than real estate?
*Yes, we have built this and tested using a few industries during our development including automotive, boating, and other types of gallery sites.*

1. *Are there any special settings I should be aware of?*
*The path to your OpenRealty install is a relative path from the servers root and it is important to get this right or the plugin will fail to function. It is also important to note that if you create a landing page for any of the WP Realty elements that those pages do not have the same name as your OpenRealty installation directory. So for instance if you have OpenRealty installed in /openrealty/ and your permalinks structure is /%postname%/ where you create a new page called OpenRealty, the plugin will toss an error. For more details, please see the tutorials by visiting [WP Realty](http://www.wprealty.org "WP Realty Instructional Videos")*

1. Are there any linkback requirements?
*Linkback Requirements? As with many free plugins on WordPress.org we have an inline link back credit in our plugin as well. Being as SEO conscious as we can be we do offer an UNBRANDED NO LINKBACK version priced in accordance to common donation-ware starting at $10. This helps us fund further development while being priced so low that its easily affordable for any professional site. :-)*

`IMPORTANT! WPRealty has suffered serious support issues because of the confusion between versions. You SHOULD NOT seek support for the support ware version of this plugin here at WordPress, It simply will not be provided. Visit http://www.wprealty.org`
