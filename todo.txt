########### WP Realty To Do List ###########
Project built by Chad Broussard and Jared Ritchey as a GNU/GPL product for WordPress users. This plugin was designed for use with the OpenRealty gallery listings manager and requires WordPress 2.6+ along with OpenRealty 2.5.2+ or the variant build EZProRealty 1.0 RC +

########### Current version 1.0.3 ############
1) Installer must add default pages for rapid deployment.
2) Configuration should allow for the listings manager to reside in any directory.
3) Should NOT require that WordPress and OpenRealty occupy the same database.
4) Should be as SEF friendly as possible given the features in WordPress permalinks.
5) Must provide easy integration into blog posts.
6) Should have a featured listings option for the sidebar.
7) Should have a featured listings option for posts (next version)
8) Should have a language file for easy change to different businesses types (next version)
9) MUST have the google maps feature that can be used as a widget as well. (done but wont make this version.)
10) Add "powered by tag" like so many other plugins have.
11) Being fair we must offer commercial unbranded versions for user, server, and developer pricing and it must be priced fairly enough to not exceed what a person would normally be willing to donate to a GNU/GPL project. 

      $10 unbranded, $50 unbranded server wide, $150 unbranded or rebranded developer version. Should we allow a reseller type setup? Possibly.
      We have been discussing the option of providing a custom build version for $99 that would allow a developer to have this rebranded and partially customized.


########### Development version 1.0.4 ############
1) Add in feature so people can put featured listings like our WP Featured product into specific posts.
2) Add in some custom styling options that can be controlled from within the admin panel.
3) Add in the new bridge for vTiger WordPress (Jared and Chad)
4) Add in chads new SEF SEO toolset (works, sort of, pending more testing)
5) Add in Jareds new document management feature.
6) Add in language file so field naming can be modified by end users.
7) Add in login bridge from Jared
8) Add in external posts snippet from Chad
9) Add in our calculator suite.
10) Add in drop in rate ticker option (chads pet project)
11) Add in drop in search form.
12) GOOGLE MAPS must make this version.

########### Planned version 1.0.5 ############
1) Forclusure gateway (see Jared)
2) Add the new jQuery effect for sliding featured listings.
3) Add in default support for the All In One SEO Pack.
4) WordPress MU compatable and should be built to avoid duplicate content by leaving the main brokers site
 the only one that can have pages then providing a way for agent blogs in the MU environment to list featured listings.
5) I'd like to integrate our vieleRETS WordPress integration but may leave this open for the CSV import tool.
6) More naturally .....
